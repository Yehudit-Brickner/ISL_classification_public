# ISL_classification_public

This project built classifiers for ISL letters.
<br>21 letters were classified.
<br>There are 2 classifiers. the first is a clasifier for images that have a lot of background noise, and the second is for images with less to none background noise.

<br>The .pt files are the NN weights and biasis.
<br>The load_and_run_best_models.ipynb has code to run the models on a test data set. 
<br>The videoTry.py file opens the computers webcam so that you can take images and right away clasify them.
